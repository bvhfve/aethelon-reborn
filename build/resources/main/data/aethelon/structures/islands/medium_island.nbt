# This is a placeholder for the medium_island.nbt file
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary NBT file created using structure blocks
# or exported from a world using tools like WorldEdit or Litematica

# To create actual NBT structure files:
# 1. Build your structure in a Minecraft world
# 2. Use structure blocks to save the structure
# 3. Copy the .nbt file from your world's generated/structures folder
# 4. Place it in this directory

# Example structure dimensions for medium_island:
# - Size: 24x12x24 blocks
# - Contains: grass platform, trees, small pond, decorative elements
# - Biome compatibility: ocean, deep_ocean, warm_ocean, lukewarm_ocean, cold_ocean
